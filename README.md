# Roundcube Plugin Single User Autologon

This plugin automatically logins in a configurable user to roundcube.

It may be used if you would like to make a single email-account available to
all users without sharing the accounts password with all users.

See our [docker-roundcubemail](https://github.com/radiorabe/docker-roundcubemail)
for an example on how to use this.
